## Description

PillCam Colon is a disposable capsule that uses a miniaturized camera to
visualize the colon. The data obtained from this procedure (capsule endoscopy) is widely used
by doctors to detect and diagnose diseases and identify polyps.
The captured images contain tissue, bubbles, content, and lumen. Semantic segmentation of the images can assist in many applications, such as detection of pathologies, analysis of the cleansing level and increasing confidence of various detectors.
This project focuses on developing a smart annotation tool for labeling new data, with
suggestions based on a deep learning model prediction used as guidelines for the annotator.
The students will develop a GUI that presents images to an annotator with annotation
suggestions based on a deep learning model (a mask, bounding box or classification score based on the task), and captures the annotatorâ€™s input. Emphasis will be placed on a UI that is
convenient and allows for efficient annotation.
